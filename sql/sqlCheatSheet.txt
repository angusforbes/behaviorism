To create a databse:

1) log in as root: mysql -u root -p
2) create database ceb;

To create a user with full privileges on a particular database: 

1) create user ceb identified by 'ceb';
2) grant all on ceb.* to 'ceb'@'localhost' identified by 'ceb';

2b-optional) grant all on ceb. to 'ceb'@'%' identified by 'ceb'; 
  for remote access from anywhere!

Now user (ceb) can login to this database (ceb) with a password (also ceb!):

1) mysql ceb -u ceb -p
		password: ceb



to recover from a dumped file do:
mysql ceb -u ceb -p <backupfiledir/backupfile.txt

to dump the current db to a text file do:
shell> mysqldump ceb -u ceb -p > myDump.txt (will ask for pw in the next line)
